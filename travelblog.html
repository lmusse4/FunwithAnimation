      Visiting Orlando and Disney World was a truly magical experience with an
      array of theme parks, attractions, and entertainment options. In 2018, my
      family and I went to visit which quickly became an unforgetable
      experience. They also have some of the most thrilling rides in the world
      with so many different shows to attend. My favorite part was visiting
      Magic kingdom with all our favorite disney characters and a spectacular
      firework show we could never forget.
